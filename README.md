A bot that helps out owners of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms, otherwise known as Realm Plus's.

There are three things the bot can do: keep a log of players who have joined and left, deal with season roles and their management, and verify the gamertags of users.

More features are planned to be added eventually.

If you wish to add this bot, join the Support Server and talk to me (Sonic49) - I'll talk about how to set it up and all, since it isn't simple.

Environmental vars: `MAIN_TOKEN`, `OPENXBL_KEY`, `XAPI_KEY`, `GLOT_KEY`, `CONFIG_URL`
