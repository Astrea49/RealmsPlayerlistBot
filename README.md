A bot that helps out owners of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms by showing a log of players who have joined and left.

## The Playerlist
The playerlist/player log is a *very* in-demand feature. For a good reason, too - it's something not many other bots do.

It looks something like this:

The list automatically runs/gets generated in a channel every hour, giving a useful hourly view of who all was on at what time, though there *is* also a command you can run to get who all was on in the last 24 hours.

The command can normally only be run by people with Manage Server permissions and is not meant to be seen by normal people - there *is* a command that can be run by everyone that allows you to view everyone currently online, though.

## Self-hosting Information

Honestly, *good luck*. This thing is *far* from simple to get everything working, requiring you to know the ins-and-outs of most of the libraries I use. It can be a mess, and gathering the databases and servers needed even more so. There's also not much room for simplification here.

But if you're willing to try... well, I won't leave a detailed guide here - just kinda poke around in the code and see what works. [`xbox-webapi-python`](https://github.com/OpenXbox/xbox-webapi-python) is worth looking if you're even considering it.
